Adaptive Signal Processing Project

Project members - Robin Abrahamse, Shashang Murali

# Project Description

- The project involves cleaning of noisy audio provided by "mic1.wav" with the help of noise only file "mic2.wav".
- The initial approach tested was weiner filters (FIR, Causal, Non-Causal). The results from these filters were not satisfactory.
- LMS, NLMS and RLS filters were tested and gave out a sufficiently clean audio. The results of these filters are shown in the file "Adaptive_Signal_Processing___Project_2_Presentation".
